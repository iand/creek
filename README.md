# Creek

A Go client for [Estuary](https://github.com/application-research/estuary)

This is a work in progress with only partial coverage of the Estuary API. 
See the [demo](cmd/creekdemo) for examples of usage.

Currently implemented:

 - Estuary: get health, get node info
 - Public services: info about cid, miner stats, miner deals, miner deal failures, storage ask
 - Content: add from file and add from ipfs
 - Pins: list, add, get, replace and delete
